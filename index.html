            In 2018, there is no reason – no good excuse – not to upgrade any 
            site to HTTPS by acquiring an SSL certificate. Starting in August 
            2018, the most popular web browser on the planet, Google Chrome, 
            will give a big red warning to your visitors if your site is not 
            fully secure. Firefox is already doing this, and Microsoft’s Edge 
            and Apple’s Safari are sure to follow. So make sure you get an SSL 
            certificate and keep it up to date. This will protect your content 
            from being covertly altered and prevent your customers’ information 
            from being monitored or stolen.

              Depending on the size, complexity and, most critically, the 
              client’s active involvement in the process, a website takes 
              anywhere between six and 24 weeks to build and launch. Some 
              incredibly large projects have broken the year mark.

              We have the team of developers and web designers, as well as 
              the project management processes, in place to build and deliver 
              the most friendly, accessible and speed-optimized websites 
              available.

              We’re always here to help! We can cover emergencies and 
              non-emergencies alike. Just be sure to give us as many details 
              as possible about the problem: the browser you were using when 
              you noticed the problem, your computer’s operating system, time 
              of day, what actions you were performing, what device you were 
              using when you saw the problem, etc.
